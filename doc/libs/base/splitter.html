<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The splitter is intended for corresponding subsets of bits
to the bits within a multi-bit value. Despite its name, it can either
split a multi-bit value into component parts, or it can combine
component parts into a multi-bit value, or it can do both at once.
A more complete description of splitters is found in the `<a
href=../../guide/bundles/splitting.html>Splitters</a>' section of the
<em>User's Guide</em>.</p>

<p>Logisim treats splitters specially when propagating values within a
circuit: Whereas all other components have a computed delay for purposes
of simulating their behavior, values propagate through splitters (as
well as wires) instantaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The term <em>splitter</em> is a non-standard
term, which is unique to Logisim as far as I know. I am unaware of any
standard term for such a concept; the only term I have heard used is
<em>bus ripper</em>, but this term is unnecessarily violent for my
tastes.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>To distinguish the several connecting points for a splitter, we refer
to the single connecting point one side as its <em>combined end</em>,
and we refer to the multiple connecting points on the other side as its
<em>split ends</em>.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Combined end (input/output bit width matches Bit Width attribute)
<dd>A value holding all of the bits traveling through the splitter.

<dt>Split ends (input/output, bit width computed based on Bit <var>x</var> attributes)
<dd>The number of split ends is specified in the Fan Out attribute, and
each split end has an index that is at least 0 and less than the Fan Out
attribute. For each split end, all bits for which Bit <var>x</var>
refers to its index travels through that split end; the order of these
bits is the same as their order within the combined end.

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Facing
<dd>The location of the split ends relative to the combined end.

<dt>Fan Out
<dd>The number of split ends.

<dt>Bit Width
<dd>The bit width of the combined end.

<dt>Bit <var>x</var>
<dd>The index of the split end to which bit <var>x</var> of the combined
end corresponds. The split ends are indexed starting from 0 at the top
(for a splitter facing east or west) or from 0 at the left/west (for a
splitter facing north or south). A bit can be specified to correspond to
none of the split ends. There is no way for a bit to correspond to
multiple split ends.
