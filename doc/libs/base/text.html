<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The text tool allows you to create and edit labels associated with
components. Which components support labels are indicated in the 'Text
Tool Behavior' section of their documentation. As of the current
release, three components in the built-in libraries support labels.
<center><table>
<tr><td valign=top><strong>Base library</strong></td>
     <td><a href=pin.html>Pin</a>
	 <br><a href=clock.html>Clock</a>
	 <br><a href=label.html>Label</a>
	 </td></tr>
</table></center>
Clicking on one of these components using the text tool indicates that
you wish to edit the label associated with that component, even if you
click the component nowhere near where the label will actually appear.
Clicks at other locations indicate that you wish to create a new label
component.</p>

<p>In the current version of Logisim, text editing features are
still fairly primitive.
Selections of a region of text within a label is impossible.
There is no way to insert a line break into a label.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>The attributes for the tool are the same as for the <a
href=label.html>label component</a>. These attributes have no effect
when editing the label on an existing component, but they are imparted
to any labels created using the text tool.</p>

<p>Clicking on a component supporting the Text Tool will
display that component's attributes.</p>
