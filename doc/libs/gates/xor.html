<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The XOR, XNOR, Even Parity, and Odd Parity gates each compute
the respective function of the inputs, and emit the result on the
output.
The two-input truth table for the gates is the following.

<tr><th><var>x</var></th><th><var>y</var></th><th>XOR</th>
	<th>XNOR</th><th>Odd</th><th>Even</th></tr>

As you can see, the Odd Parity gate and the XOR gate behave identically
with two inputs; similarly, the even parity gate and the XNOR gate
behave identically.
But if there are more than two specified inputs, the XOR gate will emit
1 only when there is exactly one 1 input, whereas the Odd Parity gate
will emit 1 if there are an odd number of 1 inputs.
The XNOR gate will emit 1 only when there is <em>not</em> exactly one 1
input, while the Even Parity gate will emit 1 if there are an even
number of 1 inputs.</p>

<p>Any inputs that are unspecified (i.e., floating) are ignored. If all
inputs are floating, then the output is floating, too. If any of the
inputs are the error value (e.g., if conflicting values are coming into
the same wire), then the output will be the error value, too.</p>

<p>The multi-bit versions of each gate will perform its one-bit
transformation bitwise on its inputs.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many authorities contend that the shaped XOR
gate's behavior should correspond to the odd parity gate, but there is
not agreement on this point.  Logisim's behavior for XOR gates is based
on the IEEE 91 standard. It is also consistent with the intuitive
meaning underlying the term <em>exclusive or</em>: A waiter asking
whether you want a side dish of mashed potatoes, carrots, peas, or cole
slaw will only accept one choice, not three, whatever some authorities
may tell you. (I must admit, though, that I have not subjected this
statement to a rigorous test.)</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

<dt>West edge (inputs, bit width according to Bit Width attribute)
<dd>The inputs into the component. There will be as many of these as
specified in the Number of Inputs attribute.</p>

<p>Note that if you are using shaped gates, the west side of XOR and
XNOR gates will be curved. Nonetheless, the input pins are in a line.
Logisim will draw short stubs illustrating this; and if you overshoot a
stub, it will silently assume that you did not mean to overshoot it. In
"printer view", these stubs will not be drawn unless they are connected
to wires.</p>

<dt>East edge (output, bit width according to Bit Width attribute)
<dd>The gate's output, whose value is computed based on the current
inputs as described above.

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Facing
<dd>The direction of the component (its output relative to its inputs).

<dt>Bit Width
<dd>The bit width of the component's inputs and outputs.

<dt>Gate Size
<dd>Determines whether to draw a wider or narrower version of the
component. This does not affect the number of inputs, which is specified
by the Number of Inputs attribute; however, if the number of inputs exceeds 3 (for a
narrow component) or 5 (for a wide component), then the gate will
be drawn with "wings" to be able to accommodate the number of inputs
requested.

<dt>Number of Inputs
<dd>Determines how many pins to have for the component on its west
side.
