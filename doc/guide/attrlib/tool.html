<h1>Tool attributes</h1>

<p>Every tool for adding components to a circuit also has a set of
attributes, which are imparted to the components created by the tool,
although the components' attributes may be changed later without
affecting the tool's attributes.  When you select a tool, Logisim
will change the attribute table to display that tool's attributes.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we want to create smaller AND gates.
We've already seen that an AND gate's Gate Size attribute is not
editable. But the Gate Size attribute <em>is</em>
editable for the AND gate <em>tool</em>: To view and edit this
attribute, click the tool's icon in the toolbar (or the explorer
pane), and change its Gate Size attribute.

Now, we can delete the two existing AND gates and add two new
AND gates in their place. This time, they will be narrow.
(If you chose to reduce the number of inputs to 3, the AND gate
would not have vertical extension on the left side. But you'd also
have to rewire the circuit so that the wires hit the AND gate's left
side.)

With some tools, the icon reflects some of the attributes'
values. One example of this is with the Pin tool, whose icon
faces the same way as its Facing attribute says.</p>

<p>The tools in the toolbar each have a separate attribute set from
the corresponding tools in the explorer pane. Thus, even though we
changed the toolbar's AND tool to create narrow AND gates, the AND
tool in the Gates library will still create wide AND gates unless
you change its attributes too.</p>

<p>In fact, the input pin and output pin tools in the default
toolbar are both instances of the Base library's Pin tool, but
the three attribute sets are different. The icon for the Pin tool
is drawn as a circle or a square depending on the value of its
``Output?'' attribute.</p>

<p>Logisim provides a handy shortcut for changing the Facing attribute
that controls the direction in which many components face: Typing an
arrow key while that tool is selected automatically changes the
direction of the component.</p>
