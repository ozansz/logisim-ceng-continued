<h1>Creating bundles</h1>

<p>Every input and output on every component in the circuit has a
bit width associated with it. Many of Logisim's built-in components
include attributes allowing you to customize the bit widths of
their inputs and outputs.</p>

<p>The below screen shot illustrates a simple circuit
for finding the bitwise AND of two three-bit inputs; each pin
has its Bit Width attribute customized for dealing with
three-bit data, as with the pictured AND gate attributes.

Notice that the input and output pins are drawn with three bits,
and the output is the bitwise AND of the inputs.</p>

<p>For components, all inputs and outputs must have their bit
widths defined. In contrast, a wire's bit width is undefined:
Instead, the wire's width adapts to the components to which it
is attached.
If a wire connects two components demanding different bit widths,
Logisim will complain of ``Incompatible widths'' and indicate the
offending locations in orange.
In the below, the output pin's Bit Width attribute has been
changed to 1, and so Logisim complains that the wire cannot
connect a three-bit value to a one-bit value.

Wires that connect incompatible locations (drawn in orange)
do not carry values.</p>

<p>For single-bit wires, you can see at a glance what value it
is carrying because Logisim colors the wire light
or dark green depending the value.
It does not display values for multi-bit wires: They are simply
black. You can, though, probe a wire by clicking it using the
poke tool (<img width=16 height=16 src=../../icons/poke.gif>).

This probing feature is helpful for debugging circuits using
wire bundles.</p>
