<h1>The Simulation tab</h1>

<p>The Simulation tab allows configuration of the algorithm used for
simulating circuits. These parameters apply to all circuits being
simulated in the same window, even for circuits that exist in other
libraries loaded within the project.</p>

<ul>

<li> The <strong>Add Noise To Component Delays</strong> check box
allows you to enable or disable the random noise that is added to the
delays of components. The internal simulation uses a hidden clock for
its simulation, and to provide a somewhat realistic simulation, each
component (excluding wires and splitters) has a delay between when it
receives an input and when it emits an output. If this option is
enabled, Logisim will occassionally (about once every 16
component reactions) make a component take one click longer than
normal.  This randomness is added specifically for handling latch
circuit (as below): Without the random noise, the circuit oscillates,
since the two gates will work in lockstep; but with random noise added,
one gate will eventually outrun the other.

I recommend keeping this option on. The option exists in case you want
deterministic circuit behavior. (Also, the random noise feature is
relatively new to Logisim, and it could possibly lead to unanticipated
bugs in the simulation.)</p>

<li> The <strong>Iterations Until Oscillation</strong> combo box
specifies how long to simulate a circuit before deciding that it is
oscillating. The number represents the number of clicks of the internal
hidden clock (a simple gate takes just one click). The default of 1,000
is good enough for almost all purposes, even for large circuits. But you
may want to increase the number of iterations if you are working with a
circuit where Logisim reports false oscillations; I can imagine problems
with a circuit that incorporates many of the above latch circuits
causing such a problem.  You may want to decrease the number of
iterations if you are working with a circuit that in prone to
oscillating and you are using an unusually slow processor.</p>
