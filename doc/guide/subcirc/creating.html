<h1>Creating circuits</h1>

<p>Every Logisim project is actually a library of circuits. In
its simplest form, each project has only one circuit (called
"main" by default), but it is easy to add more:
Select Add Circuit... from the Project menu, and type any name
you like for the new circuit you want to create.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to build a 1x2 multiplexer named "1x2 MUX."
After adding the circuit, Logisim will look like this.

In the explorer pane, you can now see that the project now
contains two circuits, "main", and "1x2 MUX." Logisim draws a
magnifying glass over the icon of the circuit currently being
viewed; the current circuit name also appears in the window's
title bar.</p>

<p>After editing the circuit to appear like a 1x2 multiplexer,
we might end up with the following circuit.
