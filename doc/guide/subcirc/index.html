<h1>Subcircuits</h1>

<p>As you build circuits that are more and more sophisticated, you will
want to build smaller circuits that you can use multiple times
in larger circuits.
In Logisim, such a smaller circuit that is used in a larger
circuit is called a <strong>subcircuit</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with computer programming, you're familiar with
the subprogram concept (called <em>subroutines</em>, <em>functions</em>,
or <em>methods</em> in different languages). The subcircuit concept
is analogous to the concept in computer programming, and it is
used for the same purposes: To break a large job into bite-sized pieces,
to save the effort of defining the same concept multiple times, and to
facilitate debugging.</p>
