<h1>The Project menu</h1>

<dl>

<dt><strong>Add Circuit...</strong>
<dd>Adds a new circuit into the current project. Logisim will
insist that you name the new circuit. The name must not match
any existing circuits in the project.</p>

<dt><strong>Load Library</strong>
<dd>Loads <a href=../attrlib/explore.html>a library</a> into the
project. You can load three types of libraries, as explained <a
href=../attrlib/explore.html>elsewhere in the <em>User's
Guide</em></a>.</p>

<dt><strong>Unload Libraries...</strong>
<dd>Unloads current libraries from the circuit. Logisim will
not permit you to unload any libraries currently being used,
including libraries containing components appearing in any
project circuits, as well as those with tools that appear in
the toolbar or that are mapped to the mouse.</p>

<dt><strong>Analyze Circuit</strong>
<dd>Computes a truth table and Boolean expressions corresponding
to the current circuit, displaying them in
<a href=../analyze/index.html>the Combinational Analysis window</a>.
The analysis process will only be valid for combinational circuits.
A full description of the analysis process is described
<a href=../analyze/open.html>in the
Combinational Analysis section</a>.</p>

<dt><strong>Rename Circuit...</strong>
<dd>Renames the currently displayed circuit.</p>

<dt><strong>Set As Main Circuit</strong>
<dd>Sets the currently displayed circuit to be the project's
``main circuit.'' (This menu item will be grayed out if the
current circuit is already the project's main circuit.)
The only significance of the main circuit is that it is the
circuit that first appears when a project file is opened.</p>

<dt><strong>Remove Circuit...</strong>
<dd>Removes the currently displayed circuit from the project. 
Logisim will prevent you from removing circuits that are used as
subcircuits, and it will prevent you from removing the final
circuit in a project.</p>

<dt><strong>Options...</strong>
<dd>Opens the <a href=../opts/index.html>Project Options
window</a>.</p>

</dl>

<p><strong>Next:</strong> <a href=simulate.html>The Simulate menu</a>.</p>
