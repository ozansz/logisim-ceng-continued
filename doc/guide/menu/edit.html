<h1>The Edit menu</h1>

<dl>

<dt><strong>Undo <em>XX</em></strong>
<dd>Undoes the most recently completed action affecting how the
circuit would be saved in a file. Note that this does not
include changes to the circuit state (as with manipulations
performed by the Poke Tool).</p>

<dt><strong>Cut</strong>
<dd>Removes the currently selected components from the circuit onto
Logisim's clipboard.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Logisim's clipboard is maintained separately
from the clipboard for the overall system; as a result, cut/copy/paste
will not work across different applications, even including other
running copies of Logisim. If, however, you have multiple
projects open under the same Logisim process, then you should be
able to cut/copy/paste between them.</p>

<dt><strong>Copy</strong>
<dd>Copies the currently selected components in the circuit onto
Logisim's clipboard. (See the note under the Cut menu
item.)</p>

<dt><strong>Paste</strong>
<dd>Pastes the components on Logisim's clipboard into the current
selection.  (See the note under the Cut menu item.)</p>

<p>When you paste components, they will not immediately be
dropped; instead, they will be drawn in light gray. They will
not actually be ``dropped'' into the circuit until you either
move the selection or change the selection so that the
components are no longer in it.</p>

<p>The reason for this odd behavior is this: To be consistent with
its other behavior, Logisim must immediately merge any wires as soon
as they are dropped into a circuit; this merging process changes
existing wires in the circuit.  When you paste wires from the
clipboard, however, you may to place them in a different location,
and the changing inherent in the merging process would be against
your wishes.</p>

<dt><strong>Delete</strong>
<dd>Removes all components in the current selection from the
circuit.</p>

<dt><strong>Select All</strong>
<dd>Selects all components in the current circuit.</p>
