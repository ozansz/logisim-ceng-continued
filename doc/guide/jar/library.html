<h1>Library Class</h1>

<p>The access point for the JAR library is a class that extends the
<code>Library</code> class. The library's main job is to list the tools that are
available through the library; most often, the tools are all tools
to add the various components defined - that is, instances of the
<code>AddTool</code> class working with different component factories.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

     * libraries contain tools, which is a slightly more general concept
     * than component classes; practically speaking, though, there
     * shouldn't be much reason to invent tools beyond new instances of
     * <code>AddTool</code>.

     * Logisim accesses first when it opens the JAR file: It looks for
