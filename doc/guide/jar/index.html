<h1>JAR Libraries</h1>

<h2>Using JAR libraries</h2>

<p>Logisim has two types of circuit components: those that
are designed as Logisim circuits, and those that are
written in Java. Logisim circuits are easier to design, but
they cannot support sophisticated user interaction, and they
are relatively inefficient.</p>

<p>Logisim contains a fairly thorough collection of built-in
libraries of Java components, but it can also load additional
libraries written by third parties. Once you have downloaded
a library, you can import it into your project by right-clicking
the project in the explorer pane (the top line) and choosing
Load JAR Library....</p>

<p>Then, Logisim will prompt you to select the JAR file. If the
JAR file doesn't contain information about it, Logisim will then
may prompt you to type the class name, which should be provided
by the third party. (Developers can avoid this second prompt by including
a <q>manifest</q> file in the JAR with a Library-Class attribute
specifying the main class name.)
After this, the library's components will
be available.</p>

<h2>Creating JAR libraries</h2>

<p>The remainder of this section is dedicated to a series of
thoroughly commented examples illustrating how to develop Logisim
libraries yourself. You should only attempt this if you're
an experienced Java programmer. You will find the documentation
beyond these examples fairly meager.</p>

<p>You can download a JAR file that allows these examples to be
imported into Logisim via the Logisim Web site's Links section.
That JAR file also contains the source code
contained in these examples; this source code is in the public
domain. (In contrast, the source code to Logisim is released
under the GNU Public License.)</p>

<dt><a href=byteincr.html>Byte Incrementer</a>
<dd>Illustrates the essential components of any component type
using a simple example of a component that inputs one 8-bit value
and emits that value plus one.</p>

<dt><a href=library.html>Library Class</a>
<dd>Illustrates how to define a library. This is the entry point
for any JAR file - the class whose name the user enters when
loading the JAR library.</p>

<dt><a href=genincr.html>General Incrementer</a>
<dd>Illustrates how to make components customizable through
the usage of attributes, by generalizing the byte incrementer
to work with any bit width for the input and output.</p>

<dt><a href=basiccounter.html>Basic Counter</a>
<dd>Illustrates how to make a component that has internal state,
in particular an 8-bit counter that remembers a current value and
increments each time its clock input encounters a rising edge.</p>

<dt><a href=counter.html>Counter</a>
<dd>Demonstrates a complete, fairly sophisticated component with
which the user can interact. It implements a counter (where the
number of bits remembered is customizable) where the user can
edit the current value by clicking on it with the Poke Tool and
typing a value.</p>
