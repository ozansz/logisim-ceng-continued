<h1>Gate delays</h1>

<p>As an example of the level of sophistication of Logisim's algorithm,
consider the following circuit.

This ``obviously'' always outputs 0. But NOT gates don't react
instantaneously to their inputs in reality, and neither do they in
Logisim. As a result, when this circuit's input changes from 0 to 1, the
AND gate will briefly see two 1 inputs, and it will emit a 1 briefly.
You won't see it on the screen. But the effect is observable when we
use the AND gate's output as an input into the clock of a D flip-flop.

Poking the 0 input to become 1 leads to an instantaneous 1 going
into the D flip-flop, and thus the flip-flop's value will toggle
every time the circuit input goes from 0 to 1.</p>

<p>Every component has a delay associated with it. More sophisticated
components built into Logisim tend to have larger delays, but
these delays are somewhat arbitrary and may not reflect reality.</p>

<p>Occassionally, and with uneven frequency, Logisim will add a delay to
a component's propagation. This is intended to simulate the unevenness
of real circuits. In particular, an R-S latch using two NOR gates will
oscillate without this randomness, as both gates will process their
inputs in lockstep. This randomness can be disabled via the <a
href=../opts/index.html>Project Options</a> window's <a
href=../opts/simulate.html>Simulation tab</a>.</p>

<p>From a technical point of view, it is relatively easy to deal with
this level of sophistication in a single circuit.  Dealing with gate
delays well across subcircuits, though, is a bit more complex;
Logisim does attempt to address this correctly.</p>

<p>Note that I'm stopping short of saying that Logisim
always addresses gate delays well.  But at least it tries.</p>
