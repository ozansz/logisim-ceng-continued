<h1>Shortcomings</h1>

<p>Logisim's propagation algorithm is more than sophisticated enough
for almost all educational purposes; but it is not sophisticated
enough for industrial circuit design. In order from most damning to
least damning, the shortcomings of Logisim's propagation technique
include:
<ul>

<li>Logisim cannot simulate subcircuits whose pins sometimes behave
as inputs and sometimes behave as outputs. Components built using
Java can have such pins, though: Within the built-in libraries,
the Memory library's RAM circuit contains a D pin that acts both
as an input and as an output.</p>

<li>Logisim cuts off its simulation after a fixed number of iterations
assuming that there is an oscillation error.
Conceivably, a large circuit that does not oscillate could lead to
trouble.</p>

<li>Except for the issue of gate delays, Logisim does not particularly
concern itself with timing issues. Its introduction of occassional
randomness in component delays makes the situation somewhat more realistic,
but it is still a very idealized version of reality.</p>

<li>Logisim does nothing with respect to discriminating between
voltage levels: A bit can be only on, off, unspecified, or error.</p>

<li>There are additional shortcomings, too, that I have omitted because
they are so obscure that if you were aware of them, it would be obvious
that Logisim comes nowhere close to that level. As an extreme example,
I have a friend who works for a major chip manufacturer, and his
job is to worry about ``bubbles'' in chips' nanometer-wide wires growing
and leading to random disconnection.</p>

<li>Even beyond this, I am not a circuit design specialist; thus,
there may well be errors in the propagation technique of which I am
not aware. I welcome corrections from experts.</p>
