<h2>Step 1: Adding gates</h2>

<p>Recall that we're trying to build the following circuit in Logisim.

<p>Building a circuit is easiest by inserting the gates first as a sort
of skeleton for connecting wires into the circuit later.
The first thing we're going to
do is to add the two AND gates. Click on the AND tool in the toolbar
(<img width=16 height=16 src=../../icons/andGate.gif>, the
next-to-last tool listed).
Then click in the editing area where
you want the AND gates to go. Be sure to leave plenty of room
for stuff on the left.

Notice the five dots on the left side of the AND gate. These are spots
where wires can be attached. It happens that we'll just use two of them
for our XOR circuit; but for other circuits, you may find that having
more than two wires going to an AND gate is useful.</p>

<p>Now add the other gates.  First click on the OR tool (<img
width=16 height=16 src=../../icons/orGate.gif>); then click where you want it. And select
the NOT tool (<img width=16 height=16 src=../../icons/notGate.gif>) and put those two
gates into the canvas.

I left a little space between the NOT gates and the AND gates; if you
want to, though, you can put them up against each other and save
yourself the effort of drawing a wire in later.</p>

<p>Now we want to add the two inputs <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> into
the diagram. Select the input pin (<img width=16 height=16
src=../../icons/pinInput.gif>), and place the pins down.
You should also place an output pin (<img width=16 height=16
src=../../icons/pinOutputReversed.gif>)
next to the OR gate's output.
(Again, though I'm leaving a bit of space between the OR gate and the output
pin, you might choose to place them right next to each other.)

<p>If you decide you don't like where you placed something, then you can
right-click (or control-click) anything in the canvas to
view a pop-up menu. Choose Delete. You can also rearrange things using
the select tool (<img width=16 height=16 src=../../icons/select.gif>).</p>
