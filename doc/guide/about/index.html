<h1>About the program</h1>

<p>Logisim is open-source software. The source code is included
in the <code>src</code> subdirectory of the distributed JAR file.</p>

<p>If you find Logisim useful, please let me know. <em>Especially</em>
do this if you are an educational institution; the information will
help me in gaining support for the work.

<p>I welcome e-mails about Logisim, including bug reports, suggestions,
and fixes. When you e-mail me, please remember that I have worked hard
to produce Logisim without receiving any payment from you.  If you want
a right to complain about the software, then I would suggest shelling
out the money for a competing program to Logisim. (I know of no
open-source competitors that approach Logisim's feature set.)
Nonetheless, I remain interested in continuing to improve Logisim, and
your suggestions will be most welcome.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>The source code to Logisim is primarily my own work; I must
acknowledge my employers who fund my work as a professor, including
this program: I started the program at Saint John's
University (Collegeville, Minnesota, USA) in 2000-2004, and I have
continued it at Hendrix College (Conway, Arkansas, USA) from 2004
to present. I am very grateful to these colleges for
giving me the time and resources to work on this project. If only
all colleges and universities had their act as together and cared as
much about excellent teaching as these colleges do!</p>

<p>Second is Pablo Leal Ramos, who developed
the Spanish translation for version 2.1.0 while studying at Hendrix
as a foreign exchange student from Spain.</p>

<p>Finally, and just as significantly, are two
groups of students that worked through early versions of Logisim:
the Spring 2001 CSCI 150 classes at the College of Saint Benedict and
Saint John's University, which used the most rudimentary versions when
Logisim was being developed; and the Spring 2005 CS61C class at the
University of California, Berkeley, which beta-tested the earliest
iterations of version 2.0. These students put up with <em>many</em>
bugs, and I am <strong>very</strong> appreciative for their patience
and for their suggestions!</p>

<p>Several pieces of Logisim come from others' packages that Logisim
uses; several of these pieces are distributed as part of Logisim.
<dl>

<dt>Sun's Java API (obviously)

<dt>Sun's Javahelp project
<dd>Help systems

<dt>JDOM, from <em>www.jdom.org</em>
<dd>Reading and saving XML data.

<dt>MRJAdapter, from Steve Roy
<dd>Integration with the Macintosh OS X platform.

<dt>launch4j, from Grzegorz Kowalt
<dd>Allows distribution of Logisim as a Windows executable.

<dt>GIFEncoder, from Adam Doppelt
<dd>Saving images as GIF files. This was itself based on C code
written by Sverre H. Huseby.

<p>And finally, I want to thank all the users who have contacted me -
whether with bug reports, with suggestions, or just to let me know
that they're using Logisim in their classes. I have to leave these
suggesters anonymous, because I don't have their permission to mention
them here, but:
Thank you!</p>
